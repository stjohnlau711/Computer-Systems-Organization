      - print the question_or_answer field, which will be a yes/no question.
      - read the response from the user
      - If the response is yes, follow the left field to the next node. Otherwise,
        follow the right field.
      

      Otherwise, if the left and right fields are NULL (i.e. the node is a leaf), 
      then the question_or_animal field contains an animal. Print the
      the question_or_animal field as the guess and prompt the user
      if the guess was correct. If the guess was correct, then

           - prompt the user for the name of the new animal she was thinking of
           - prompt the user for a yes or no question distinguishing the new animal from the guessed animal
	   - ask the user what the answer for the new animal would be (yes or no)
           - create a new node with the new animal in the question_or_animal field
	   - create another new node that has the guessed animal in the question_or_animal field
           - make the two new nodes the children of the current node, where the animal for which the
             answer to the question is "yes" is the left child and the other animal is the right child.
           - overwrite the question_or_animal field of the current node with the new question.

      Note that the tree is a strictly binary tree, i.e. left and right fields of each node are either both NULL or 
      both valid pointers to child nodes (in other words, each node is a leaf or has exactly two children).
