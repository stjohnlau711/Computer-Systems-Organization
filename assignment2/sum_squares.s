	# This is the definition of the sum_squares function.
	# See the declaration in sum_squares.h
	# The function takes one parameter:
	#   -- a 32-bit integer n in the %edi register
	# It returns the sum of squares of the numbers from 1 to n.
	# The return value, being 32 bits, must be placed in the %eax register.
	
_sum_squares:                            

	# In general, you can overwrite the 64-bit
	# registers %rax, %rcx, %rdx, %rsi, %rdi, %r8, %r9, %r10, %r11,
	# as well as their 32-bit halves, %eax, %ecx, %edx,
	# %esi, %edi, %r8d, %r9d, %r10d, %r11d as you like. These are
	# the "caller-saved" registers.

	# NOTE: In this assignment, you only need to use 32-bit
	# registers for the computation (i.e. %eax, %ecx, %edx, etc.)
